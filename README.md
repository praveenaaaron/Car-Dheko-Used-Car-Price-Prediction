# Car-Dheko---Used-Car-Price-Prediction
## Domain:
* Automotive Industry , Data Science, Machine Learning
## Introduction:
* In this project, the task is to enhancing the customer experience and 
optimizing the pricing process for used cars by developing a machine learning 
model. This model, based on historical car price data, will take into account 
various features such as the car's make, model, year, fuel type, and transmission 
type. The goal is to predict the prices of used cars accurately and integrate this 
model into an interactive web application using Streamlit.
## Skills take away From This Project:
* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Machine Learning Model Development
* Price Prediction Techniques
* Model Evaluation and Optimization
* Model Deployment
* Streamlit Application Development
* Documentation and Reporting
## Results: 
### Random Forest: 
* Achieved the best performance with the highest RÂ² and the lowest 
MSE/MAE, making it the chosen model for deployment.
* Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid Search was employed to identify the 
optimal parameters, such as n_estimators and max_depth. By 
systematically testing a range of values for these parameters, Grid Search 
helped in determining the best combination that enhances the Random 
forest model's performance.
##  Streamlit Application Development:
 * Deploying the predictive model through the Streamlit application 
revolutionizes the user experience at CarDekho by delivering swift and 
reliable price estimates for used cars.
